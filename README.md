Old Testament -- An American Translation

This was originally published in 1927 and went public domain Jan 1, 2022. So I wanted to post a text.

I used the scans on archive.org. Mainly I used scans from the School of Theology at Claremont found here:

but a couple of pages were missing. I filled them in with scans from the Public Library of India:

I did OCR with Tesseract 4.0. I used a couple of custom text models and some custom image processing.

The text file OT_aat.txt uses a fair number of unicode characters so the font you use to display it can matter. I'm using Cousine, and I used it to generate the pdf file OT_aat.pdf. Considering it is a monospace font it has pretty decent Hebrew characters. It also has huge quotation marks which makes proofreading a lot easier.
