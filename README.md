Old Testament -- An American Translation

This was originally published in 1927 went public domain Jan 1, 2022. So I wanted to post a text.

I used the scans on archive.org. Mainly I used scans from the School of Theology at Claremont found here:

but a couple of pages were missing. I filled them in with scans from the Public Library of India:

I did OCR with Tesseract 4.0. I used a couple of custom text models and some custom image processing.
