The Old Testament -- An American Translation

This was originally published in 1927 and went public domain Jan 1, 2022. So I wanted to post a text.

I used the scans on archive.org. Mainly I used scans from the School of Theology at Claremont found here:

but a couple of pages were missing. I filled them in with scans from the Public Library of India:

I did OCR with Tesseract 4.0 and a couple of custom trained text models.

The text file OT_aat.txt uses a fair number of unicode characters so the font you use to display it can matter. I'm using [Cousine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine?query=cousine), and I used it to generate the pdf file OT_aat.pdf. Considering it is a monospace font it has pretty decent Hebrew characters. It also has huge quotation marks which make proofreading a lot easier. So for best results, install Cousine and use it in your text editor, or just read the pdf file.

At the moment I'm pretty sure there are still some errors in the text. I'd guess maybe between 50 and 100 actually. So if you are reading the text and you find an error (which you can verify by looking at the above mentioned scans) please let me know. My instagram name is john.saeger and you can message me there.

Thanks!!
