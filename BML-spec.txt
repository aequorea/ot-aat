BML - Markup language
=====================
Our input text is preformatted by line.
Paragraph, indexing and single line markup tokens are at the start of a line.
Blank lines when needed may be in the input text.

Paragraph markup
----------------
These are mode switchers and can terminate themselves or each other. 
For best results, put an extra token at the end of file.

`  preformatted text - don't make room for verse numbers (appendix+footnotes)
+  paragraph of normal text      - first line indented 4
>  paragraphs of verse           - indented 6
<  end of verses - continue paragraph mode - when we don't start a fresh 
                   paragraph after the verses

Indexing markup
---------------
Formats a line and can make an entry into an index. Verse and chapter markers
and numbers may appear inside paragraph or single line formatting markers, and
they may also appear inside verse numbers.

~  verse   - prefix the number   - need not be at the beginning of a line
)  chapter - number may be bold  - paragraph mode - first line indented 4
                                   abbreviation for +]
]  chapter - number may be bold  - no indentation - preserve current mode
}  book    - bold text centered  - paragraph mode
}} frugal book - fewer line feeds

Single line markup
------------------
Must appear at the beginning of the line.
These interrupt the current mode for one line.

>>   verse continuation line         - indented 8 or 10 (not consistent)
>>>  line of superindented verse     - indented 24
>>>> superindented continuation line - indented 26

#    small text centered (if available)
##   regular text centered
###  bold text centered (and/or larger if available)

___  (triple space) widen line -- move right side to right margin

Headers and footers
-------------------
These can do whatever special formatting that might be needed for the text.

/    page header
//    frugal header - fewer line feeds
\    page footer - may be blank - forces a page break

Character markup
----------------
Use in pairs - may start in middle of a line and cross line boundaries.
These do not nest well.

^    small caps
*    bold (could be red)
_    italics

Lord and God
------------
If LORD or GOD are in all caps, render in small caps if available.
